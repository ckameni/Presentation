In banking and finance, an amortizing loan is a loan where the principal of the loan is paid down over the life of the loan (that is, amortized) according to an amortization schedule, typically through equal payments.

This application will estimate what your yearly payments will be.

- Loan Amount [$]

then click **submit** in oder to  see the yearly predicted Payment,Interest,Principal and Balance.

Example: if you choose to loan an amount of 20,000$  for a period of 5 years and an interest rate of 10%, your amortization plan will look like this:

```{r echo=FALSE}
Invest<-20000
Repayment<-c(0)
Interest<-c(0)
balance<-Invest;
i<-0.1;
n <-5

#==============================================================
e<-0
tilg<-balance / n
time<-"year_0"
for(a in 2:(n+1)) {
      #tilg<-balance / n
      Repayment[a] <- tilg
      #=============================================================
      b<-a-1
      balance[a] <- balance[b] - Repayment[a]
      #=============================================================
      Interest[a] <- i * balance[b]
      c<-b-1
      time[a]<-paste0(b,"year")
}

Payment <- Interest + Repayment
balance<-abs(balance)
year<-rep("NA",(n+1))
table<-data.frame()
for(l in 1:((n+1))){table[1,l]<-year[l]}
table<- rbind(Payment,Interest,Repayment,balance)
colnames(table)<-time;  
table[,2:6]
```

The application is great tool to provide a quick design of the loan amortization.

```{r,echo=FALSE,eval=F}
# Plotting  the amortization plan.
colours <- c("red", "blue", "yellow", "green")
barplot(as.matrix(table), main="Loan Barchart", ylab = "Amounts", cex.lab = 1.5,
        cex.main = 1.4, beside=TRUE, col=colours)
legend("topleft", c("Payment","Interest","Principal","Balance"), bty="n",cex=0.7,
       fill=colours)
